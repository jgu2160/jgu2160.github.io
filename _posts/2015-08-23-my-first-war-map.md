I've been trying to find inspiration for a series of D3 graphs I'd like to someday make that center on one of my favorite subjects, war. I recently happened upon [markmarkoh's bl.ock](http://bl.ocks.org/markmarkoh/4255924), which shows notable nuclear explosions and attending information. I used native javascript instead of backbone/underscore, as I find this easier to reason about.
