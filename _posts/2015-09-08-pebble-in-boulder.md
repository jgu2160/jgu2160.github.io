Pebble nailed [it](http://pebblerocksboulder.com/). They seriously put on the best hackathon I've been to (out of the 3 I'd been to prior). Perhaps it was because it was the first hardware hackathon I'd been to, or because they gave ample food for thought. Regardless, I loved it.

My team's project was [TurnaKit](https://www.hackster.io/teamturing/turnakit), a bike add-on system that automatically signals turns for the user based upon Google Maps directions. I was in charge of creating the Pebble GUI and having it communicate with the Maps API. It was an incredibly fun project, and I see myself making more apps on this hacker-oriented smart device.

My favorite project was [LulzBlap](https://www.hackster.io/team-aboriginal-nonentity-congressmen/lulzblap), which I found to be an incredibly creative use of both the Pebble and, especially, the LulzBot printer. They essentially made an arcade game that used the Pebble as a controller: the player guided a flying toaster through a 3d-printed canyon. Genius.
