I had the pleasure of attending [Ruby for Good](http://www.rubyforgood.com/) in DC, flying with my fellow Turing alumnus Austin. We both worked on two different projects, one for [Purple Door Coffee](http://www.purpledoorcoffee.com/), a Denver nonprofit that employs homeless individuals that need a leg up, and one for [GrowHaus](http://www.thegrowhaus.org/), another Denver nonprofit which provides fresh urban farm grown food in low-income neighborhoods.

My takeaway from the entire event was not so much the coding but the energy and goodwill exuded from the community. There were a few prominent individuals from the Ruby community in attendance, and speaking with them really boosted my confidence in myself and the trueness of MINASWAN (**Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice**).

We hit DC on a budget, so we took advantage of [Capital Bike Share](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) in order to see the monuments, museums, and cool parts of town. We saw the impressionist exhibit at the National Gallery, national aerospace treasures, the exuberance of Madame's Organ, the snipers on the White House, and the satisfaction of using ruby for good. I'll definitely attend next year.
