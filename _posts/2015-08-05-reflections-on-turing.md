I last sat in the dungeon a month and a week ago, itching to find my first software development job. None of this has changed, and I think my prospects are even better than before. Turing set me up for success better than my Ivy League education ever did.

Why did Turing suit me better? I don't think I really ever wanted to become a doctor, lawyer, managment consultant, or professor. The institutions that govern the trajectory of those professions are rigid and unyielding to disruptive change (perhaps, as they should be), the antithesis to the core of software development. With the acumen I nurtured at Turing--finding the right libraries, consuming docs efficiently, and learning why Vim makes a person fast--I feel more powerful than the person (who very well could've been me) who has to rely on a bureaucracy to move forth.

All of us can follow instructions. A wonderful aspect about programming is that you only have to follow instructions for as long as you need to--not an option in fields where pedigree is the main metric of worth. A disdain for arbitrary authority is the mark of a solid programmer.
